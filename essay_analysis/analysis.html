			<h1>Structural Analysis</h1>
			<section>
				<h2>Thesis Statement</h2>
				<p>This article‘s thesis statement is in the first paragraph of <a href="essay.html#sec1">[Sec. #1]</a>. It is the first half of the second sentence. It is the thesis statement because it states the goal of the two experiments mentioned in the following paragraph and sections. Also, the keyword cocoa and the health benefits it may bring to people is clearly stated. In addition, this sentence mentioned the fact that scientists are working to gain an answer.</p>
				<p class="quote"><q>
				Whether consuming cocoa, known to be packed with powerful antioxidants that protect our cells from damage, helps us age better, is a question scientists want to definitively answer. They are looking for answers in the blood of 600 individuals age 60 and older who participated in the largest trial ever <span style="background-color: #80cdc1;">to assess the impact of a cocoa supplement as well as a common multivitamin, on reducing the risk of heart disease, stroke, cancer, and other health outcomes, </span> says Dr. Yanbin Dong, geneticist and cardiologist at the Georgia Prevention Institute at the Medical College of Georgia.

				<h2>Essay Outline</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><b><a href="essay.html#sec2">[Sec. #2]</a> - Chocolate is not healthy food even though cocoa contains antioxidants.</b><br/>
This section first explains that chocolate is popular partly because
<q>
	People think the consumption of chocolate is good for you.
</q>
The last part of this section refutes this notion by clearly stating that
<q>
	flavanols are often destroyed
</q>
when cocoa and chocolate are processed, and chocolate should not be viewed as
<q>
	a health food
</q>.
					</li>
					<li><b><a href="essay.html#sec3">[Sec. #3]</a> - So far, there is no solid evidence that cocoa is good for human health.</b><br/>
In the first paragraph, it is pointed out that	
<q>
	there had not been large scale randomized controlled trials
</q>
to prove that consuming cocoa is beneficial.The quote from Dr. Dong
<q>
	We are going to prove or dispute it,
</q>
where he used the word “prove” instead of also supports this main idea.		
					</li>
					<li><b><a href="essay.html#sec4">[Sec. #4]</a> - Scientists well learn the effects of cocoa by testing participants’ biological age and inflammaging.</b><br/>
The first sentence in this section
<q>
	Dong and his colleagues will be looking specifically at aging, including so called “inflammaging,” and epigenetic aging, both considered good indicators of our biological age.
</q>
summarizes the main idea of the whole section. So does the last part in this section, where the hypothesis of the experiment is explained:
<q>
	cocoa supplementation reduces epigenetic aging and inflammaging
</q>.			The middle part of the section focuses on explaining what biological age is and how scientists test it.
					</li>
					<li><b><a href="essay.html#sec5">[Sec. #5]</a> - People often consume chocolate, food, and dietary supplements in hope of gaining antioxidants.</b><br/>
The idea that people consume certain thing to stay healthy is indicated through phrases like
<q>
	A natural and good source of antioxidants
</q>,
<q>
	Good source of flavanols
</q>.				The second last sentence in this section uses statistics from a serve to support this idea.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Coherence & Cohesion</h2>
				<h3><a href="essay.html#sec2">[Sec. #2]</a></h3>
				<p class="cc"><span style="background-color: #dfc27d; color: white;">Coherence</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Para #1</b> - 
This section only has one paragraph, it is connected to the last paragraph in the first section by reiterating the keyword 
<q>
	cocoa
</q>. 
The previous paragraph talked about how scientists aim to prove cocoa’s effect on human health. The beginning of this paragraph 
<q>
	 Cocoa products have become a “widely consumed food”…
</q>
 makes a smooth transition because it is still talking about the same idea but from a different angle, which is how the public think of cocoa.

					</li>

				</ul>
				<p class="cc"><span style="background-color: #a6611a; color: white;">Cohesion</span></p>

				<p class="cc"><span style="background-color: #dfc27d; color: white;">Coherence</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Para #1</b> - 
This paragraph connects to the previous paragraph by repeating the keyword 
<q>
	flavanols
</q>
. Also, it talks about the main topic using this phrase 
<q>
	the anti-inflammatory might of cocoa
</q>
 in the second sentence of this paragraph.
					</li>
					<li><b>Para #2</b> - 
This paragraph introduces a new idea in the first sentence saying that the effect of multivitamins is also unproved. The transition was not awkward because the idea that something’s positive health effect does not have strong scientific evidence is shared between cocoa and multivitamins.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="cc"><span style="background-color: #a6611a; color: white;">Cohesion</span></p>

				<h3><a href="essay.html#sec4">[Sec. #4]</a></h3>
				<p class="cc"><span style="background-color: #dfc27d; color: white;">Coherence</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Para #1</b> - 
The first sentence in this paragraph 
<q>
	Dong and his colleagues will be looking specifically at aging…
</q>
 refers to the trial mentioned in the last sentence of the previous paragraph 
<q>
	… the size and duration of the COSMOS Trial is enabling him to do both
</q>
 therefore, the reader's focus can easily shift from how cocoa’s benefit to human health is not strongly proved in the previous paragraph to the trial Dr. Dong is participating in and its details in this paragraph.

					</li>
					<li><b>Para #2</b> - 
The phrase 
<q>
	pro- and anti-inflammatory factors
</q>
 in the first sentence links this paragraph back to the previous paragraph where the keyword 
<q>
	inflammation
</q>
 also appeared frequently. Keywords such as 
<q>
	 biological age
</q>
 and 
<q>
	DNA methylation
</q>
 that also appeared in the previous paragraph helps to make the transition smoother, too.
					</li>

					<li><b>Para #3</b> - 
The opening sentence 
<q>
	Inflammaging can be objectively accessed by measures like blood level of C-reactive protein…
</q>
 connects back to the first sentence in the previous paragraph 
<q>
	Dong will be analyzing levels of key pro- and anti-inflammatory factors at baseline…
</q>
. These two sentences both talk about something related to 
<q>
	inflammation
</q>
 and they both mentioned blood tests. The first sentence in the previous paragraph used the phrase 
<q>
	in the blood of those taking the cocoa supplement
</q>
 while in this paragraph testing the blood-level for a certain protein is mentioned.

				<h2>Take-home Message</h2>
				<p>In the last paragraph of the entire essay, the author quotes the story of a participant taking part in the studies that investigate early indicators of dementia. In this story, the author's writing implies some positive aspects of understanding whether you have an early development of dementia. For example, the author shows that the odds of Alzheimer's disease is <q>lower than the participant had feared</q>. The author also quotes the participant's positive attitude toward the understanding of the risk despite the need to share their personal data, like <q>I would want to use them. I'd rather know than not</q>. Thus, we can see that in general, the author tries to convince people that <span style="background-color: #80cdc1;">there are more advantages than disadvantages to use your personal data to reveal your chance of having dementia and it's better to get fully prepared</span>.</p>
				<p class="quote"><q>Paul Gondek, 68, who lives in Philadelphia and teaches social psychology at Drexel University, chose to learn his risk status two years ago, volunteering for several studies at the Penn Memory Center. Alzheimer’s tends to run in families and, having watched his mother’s slow decline from the disease, he knew he had a higher chance of developing it. To Mr. Gondek’s relief, the PET scan showed that he did not have elevated amounts of amyloid in his brain. And a calculated risk score showed that his odds of Alzheimer’s by age 85 were about 19 percent — higher than the 11 percent risk for the general population, but lower than he had feared. If other early indicators were available through driving or financial records or other behaviors and were reliable, he said, “I would want to use them. I’d rather know than not.”</q></p>
